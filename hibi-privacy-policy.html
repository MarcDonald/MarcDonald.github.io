		<h1>Hibi Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>Hibi is available as a Free and Open Source application. This application is provided by Marc Donald at no cost and is intended for use as is.
			<br>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information relating to the application Hibi.
			<br>If you choose to use this application, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. Any Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
		</p>

		<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
		<p>All Personal Information collected by Hibi (for example in Entries) is stored entirely on-device. The only time Personal Information may be sent off-device is in the event of searching for a word using the Jisho.org functionality. When searching for a word or phrase within Hibi, the search term you entered is sent to Jisho.org. Jisho.org is not operated by me. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of Jisho.org and I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of Jisho.org if you have any concerns.
			<br>The app does not use third party services other than Jisho.org that may collect information used to identify you.
		</p>

		<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
		<p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

		<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
